Features to add:

Improves:

- add some Show instances (?)

Difficulties
- splitting up the program
- reading GATDs
- making it playable in GHCI with state
- safe input with read
- really hard to track bug with an instance of Ord defined with ">"


BUGS
- no numbers in pending rules in showAllRules
- graphical bug in listplayer
- join g -> subscribing first. -> Already subscribed!
- new players created with web are not recognized under command line
- "No pending action by that number" in web. Better protect actions.
- order numbers in WEB
