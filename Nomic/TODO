
TODO list

Features to add:

- SYB

- save/restore server state on disk: Happstack?

- HCI web: Happstack?

- add enumFromTo in Obs?

- victory condition
	- action rules? more or less like Atom...

- implement quit: signal handlers

- players in Game -> vote

- show details of rules

- add a Logger/Tracer?

Improves:

- add some Show instances (?)

- headers with revision

- generalize say, putComm between Server and others?

- can we avoid running state between different levels?

- clarify run/exec/evals in State.

- avoid double connection

- reimplement quit

- prompt display?

Difficulties
- splitting up the program
- reading GATDs
- making it playable in GHCI with state
- safe input with read
- really hard to track bug with an instance of Ord defined with ">"
