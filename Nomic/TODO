
TODO list

Features to add:

- SYB
- save/restore server state on disk: Happstack?
- HCI web: Happstack?
- add enumFromTo in Obs?

- victory condition
	- action rules? more or less like Atom...

- identification method, remember players

- implement quit: signal handlers

- players in Game -> vote



Improves:

- more explicit user errors (line numbers?)

- add some Show instances (?)

- headers with revision

- generalize say, putComm between Server and others?

- can we avoid running state between different levels?

- clarify run/exec/evals in State.

Tests
- implement tests useable in darcs trackdown



Difficulties
- splitting up the program
- reading GATDs
- making it playable in GHCI with state
- safe input with read
- really hard to track bug with an instance of Ord defined with ">"


BUGS
- intrepreter segfault if object files not included in data dir
- no numbers in pending rules in showAllRules
- graphical bug in listplayer
